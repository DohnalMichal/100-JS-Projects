        I called today because I thought my account was over changed. It turns
        out it was not. Jeremi showed me where I can get my receipts and see my
        charges for the account. He walked me through the difference between a
        domain charge and a hosting charge. He even told me when payments are
        due next. Then he helped me change the administration contact. He walked
        me through the website and gave me the knowledge that I probably should
        have had a long time ago. He was clear, patient, and thorough! Every
        company deserves a team member like him. I consider myself lucky to have
        worked with him as I feel educated with your site.
